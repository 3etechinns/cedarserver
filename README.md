Cedar
===========

Cedar is an open source show control application designed for churches. Cedar handles multimedia, song lyrics and lighting, all controlled simultaneously over a network. Built using the Meteor framework, Cedar is almost entirely web-based, allowing greater flexibility than other church media software.

Cedar is currently in pre-alpha status, so not all features work properly.

Installation
============

Cedar requires the following software:

* Meteor
* FFMpeg
* GraphicsMagick

After installing the above and downloading Cedar, then simply run command `meteor` in Cedar's directory, then open a browser to http://localhost:3000/.
