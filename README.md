Cedar
===========

Cedar is an open source show control application designed for churches. Cedar handles multimedia, song lyrics and lighting, all controlled simultaneously over a network. Built using the Meteor framework, Cedar is almost entirely web-based, allowing greater flexibility than other church media software.
